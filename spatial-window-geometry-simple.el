;;; Commentary:

;; A minimal screen-to-keyboard mapping algorithm:
;; 1. Assign each keyboard cell to the window with the best overlap if it wins
;;    by a small margin; otherwise leave it unassigned (ambiguous).
;; 2. Ensure every window has at least one key by stealing the best-overlap cell
;;    from an unassigned cell or a donor with >1 key.
;; 3. Convert the grid to (window . keys) lists.
