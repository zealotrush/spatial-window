;;; Commentary:
;; Pure spatial geometry: grid assignment via row-gated weighted Voronoi.
;; A window must overlap the row band of a cell by at least
;; `spatial-window--row-overlap-min' to be eligible, discouraging
;; non-rectangular cross-row steals.  No keyboard layout dependency,
;; no Emacs frame introspection.
