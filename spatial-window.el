;;; Commentary:

;; Spatial-window provides quick window selection by mapping your keyboard
;; layout to your window layout.  Each window displays an overlay showing
;; which keys will select it, based on the spatial correspondence between
;; keyboard position and window position on screen.
;;
;; Your eyes look at the target window, your fingers know where that position
;; is on the keyboard, and you press that key to jump there.
;;
;; Usage:
;;   (require 'spatial-window)
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "M-o") #'spatial-window-select)
